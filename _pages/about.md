I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/" target="_blank">Foundations of Computational Linguistics, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany</a>. 

I've previously worked at the [Visual Analytics Group, TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/visual-analytics) - [L3S Research Center, Hanover, Germany](https://www.l3s.de/), and [Semantic Computing Group, CITEC, Bielefeld, Germany](http://sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de).




My research interests include topics such as Conversational AI, Natural Language Understanding, Computational Multimodal Models for Social Media and Web Data. [More Info](https://sherzod-hakimov.github.io/research/)
