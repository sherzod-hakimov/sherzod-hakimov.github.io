I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/" target="_blank">Foundations of Computational Linguistics, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany</a>. 

I've previously worked at the <a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/visual-analytics" target="_blank">Visual Analytics Group, TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology & L3S Research Center, Hanover, Germany</a> and <a href="http://sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/" target="_blank">Semantic Computing Group, CITEC, Bielefeld, Germany</a>.

My research interests include topics such as Conversational AI, Natural Language Understanding, Computational Multimodal Models for Social Media and Web Data. [More Info](https://sherzod-hakimov.github.io/research/)
