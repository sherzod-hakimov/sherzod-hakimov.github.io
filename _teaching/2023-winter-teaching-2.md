This seminar is part of the BSc degree in Computational Linguistics. It covers various methods from the Natural Language Processing field. The goals of the seminar are the following:

- Find out about methods used in the NLP world

- Learn to read and understand scientific publications

- Discuss the outcomes, shortcomings

- Critically review scientific publications

- Come up with the follow-up ideas
